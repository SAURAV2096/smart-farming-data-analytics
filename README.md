# Smart Agriculture Analytics: From Sensors to Harvest

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing agricultural data collected from sensors and field observations
to understand key factors influencing crop yield and productivity.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore the impact of:
- Crop type and disease
- Fertilizer and irrigation methods
- Soil moisture, pH, rainfall, sunlight, and temperature
- Region and seasonal trends

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (Power Query, DAX, Data Modeling)
- Excel / CSV
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- KPI Design & Dashboarding

## Key Features
- Interactive slicers for crop, region, fertilizer, irrigation, and disease
- Yield comparison across regions and farming practices
- Seasonal analysis by sowing and harvest month
- Visualization of environmental impact on crop yield

## Business Insights
- Organic and mixed fertilizers show higher average yields
- Sprinkler irrigation performs better than manual and drip in most regions
- Crop yield peaks during specific harvest months
- Soil moisture and sunlight have a strong correlation with yield
